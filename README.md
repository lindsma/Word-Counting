# Word-Counting

## Week 3
 
#### Objective: 
Create a function which takes a string as an argument and determines the frequency of each word in it. However, it should not include any single-character words. The result should be an object with each word being the property name and the frequency count being the value. For example, given "A cat in a hat is a silly cat indeed." as your argument, the return value should be {cat: 2, in: 1, hat: 1, is: 1, silly: 1, indeed: 1} (notice that "a" is excluded since it is a single character).
